# ðŸ”’ Authentication

T4 uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for authentication.

## ðŸ”­ Overview

The authentication flow in T4 involves the following steps:

1. User Registration: Users can register their accounts using Supabase's email authentication
   or sign in directly through various third-party providers such as Google, Apple, and Discord.
   This allows users to choose their preferred method for signing up.

2. Email Verification: After registering, users receive an email to verify their email address.
   They need to click on the verification link to confirm their account.

3. User Login: Once registered and verified, users can log in to T4 using Supabase's email authentication
   or directly through third-party providers.

4. Password Recovery: If users forget their password, they can initiate a
   password recovery process. Supabase will send them an email with
   instructions on how to reset their password. (Note: to be implemented)

## Setup

### Frontend

The frontend needs the `Supabase URL` and `Supabase Key` to initialize the Supabase client. This is your `Project URL` and public `Project API key` from the Supabase dashboard.

### Backend

The API server needs the `JWT Secret` from Supabase to verify the JWTs sent by the client.
This is placed inside `.dev.vars` as `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY`.

## Concepts Explained

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Once a user is authenticated, T4 utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
to manage and maintain user sessions. The JWT contains encoded information about the
user's identity and authentication details. This token is securely stored on the
client side (e.g., in secure storage or cookies) and sent with each request to
authenticate and authorize the user's access to protected resources.

### Authorization and Access Control

You can use a JWT to implement authorization and access control mechanisms within D1.

When creating user data, you can associate the data with the user's ID. This allows you
to restrict access to the data based on the user's privileges. For example, you can
restrict access to a user's data to only the user who created it. This is similar to
[PostgreSQL's Row Level Security (RLS).](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html)

The user's ID is stored in the JWT. You can create separate tables in your D1 database to track user roles and permissions.
