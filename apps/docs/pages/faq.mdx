# ðŸ¤” Frequently Asked Questions

## Why no Auth.js / NextAuth.js support?

NextAuth.js is web only, unfortunately.

[See this Github issue](https://github.com/timothymiller/t4-app/issues/16) for a discussion on the topic.

## Why Cloudflare D1?

In anticipation of D1 reaching a stable release soon, I've decided to use it as the default database for this project.

D1 is a great option for a few reasons:

- It's free, with the lowest costs for additional storage
- It's fast (low latency)
- It's serverless
- It's easy to use

Drizzle + D1 is a great combination for a serverless app.

In the meantime, Cloudflare R2 integration is easier than ever. The bulk of your data storage usage will likely take place in R2.

## Why no Prisma support?

Prisma is not supported in Cloudflare Workers because it's a chunky boi in terms of bundle size.
