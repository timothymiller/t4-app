## ðŸš€ Setting up Production

> Resizing images requires a paid Cloudflare Pro plan.

### API (Prod)

For deployed environments, you can use wrangler secrets to set `APP_URL` and `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` values.

For example:

Run `echo <VALUE> | wrangler secret put <NAME>` for each of these

Or [use the Cloudflare web interface](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/environment-variables/#environment-variables-via-the-dashboard).

### ðŸ¤« Setup CI/CD Secrets

> Secrets are secure environment variables you provide GitHub so that you don't need to hard code the project-token in your workflow file.

#### ðŸ”— Next.js

1. Deploying to Cloudflare Pages requires the following secrets added to your GitHub repository:

```bash
CF_API_TOKEN=
CF_ACCOUNT_ID=
CF_PROJECT_NAME=
```

2. Disable `Enable automatic production branch deployments` in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. This conflicts with our Github Actions.

#### ðŸ“± Expo

1. Go in your [Expo settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/access-tokens) to create a new access token.

2. Add the `EXPO_TOKEN` secret to your repository with the token that you retrieved from Expo to allow GitHub Actions to publish your app.

3. Create a new project in the [Expo projects](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects)

4. Add the correct `projectId` to your `apps/expo/app.json`. Update the `slug` field to match your project name. Also update the `owner` field with your Expo username.

5. Update `projectId`, `slug` and `owner` fallback field inside of `apps/expo/app.config.ts`.

6. Setup EAS credentials for your Android and IOS apps by running `eas credentials` in your terminal. Setup the correct `android.package` and `ios.bundleIdentifier` in `apps/expo/app.json`.

7. Over on your repository set the `Read and write permissions` in `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions`. This specific workflow includes only the `contents: write` permission that is needed to comment on your commits with the build download links.

8. Push your changes to GitHub and watch your app being built in EAS.

## Configure Wrangler.toml

> Wrangler is the official CLI tool for Cloudflare Workers.

Replace the `account_id` and `database_id` with your own values.

### API Wranger.toml

```toml
name = "t4-api"
compatibility_date = "2023-01-01"
send_metrics = false
account_id = "your_account_id"

[[ d1_databases ]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "your_db_name"
database_id = "your_db_id"
```

### Next.js Wranger.toml

> Replace the `name` and `route` values with your own.

```toml
[env.preview]
name = "t4-app-preview"
workers_dev = true

[env.production]
name = "t4-app"
route = "app.t4stack.com/*"
workers_dev = false
```

## Environment Variables

Configure environment variables within the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for production.

> Your API server runs as a Cloudflare Worker. Cloudflare is working on combining the Workers and Pages dashboards, so you can configure your environment variables in one place.

```bash
# Change the name of this file to .env and add your own values

# API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://api.t4stack.com/

# Authentication
# @link https://supabase.com/dashboard for your Supabase API keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

## Authentication - Supabase

To set up authentication with Supabase in your application, you will need to configure certain environment
variables and customize the email verification redirect link for production.
Head over to [](https://supabase.com/dashboard) for your Supabase API keys and set the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

You should set the `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` with wrangler, also found in Supabase as **JWT Secret** in the API Settings.

In Supabase, you need to configure the email verification redirect link for the production environment. This link determines where users will be redirected to after Supabase has confirmed their account through email verification. Make sure to set this link to your actual production website.

To set up the email verification redirect link, follow these steps:

- Go to the project settings or authentication settings.
- Look for the option to configure the email verification redirect link.
- Enter the URL of your production website that you want users to be redirected to.

By customizing this redirect link, you ensure a seamless experience for your users during the email verification process.
