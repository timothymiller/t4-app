## ğŸ”¨ Workflow

## Web

Your workflow will look like `pnpm api` followed by `pnpm web`

> Or use the shorthand `pnpm dev` to run both at the same time.

## Native

For native development, you must first run `pnpm ios` or `pnpm android` to create a development build before `pnpm native` will work.

The native environment depends on the web environment, so you must have the web environment running before you can run the native environment.

`pnpm dev`

or

`pnpm api`
`pnpm web` - Images won't work without it

> But first, you must setup your environment variables.
