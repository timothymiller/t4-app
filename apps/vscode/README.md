## Command Details
Here are the details of each command provided by the t4-app-tools extension:

### New Screen
This command allows you to create a new screen for your T4 application. Enter the name of the new screen using capitalized camel case (e.g., MyNewScreen). The command will generate a new screen.tsx file in the packages/app/features/{ScreenName} directory, add a new index.tsx file in apps/expo/app/{ScreenName}.tsx, and create a new index.tsx file in apps/next/pages/{ScreenName}.tsx that imports your new screen in Next.js. Finally, it will open the new screen.tsx file for you to modify.

### New Component
Use this command to create a new component for your UI library. Enter the name of the new component using capitalized camel case (e.g., MyNewComponent). The command will generate a new component file in the packages/ui/src/components folder. After creation, it will open the new {ComponentName}.tsx file for you to modify.

### New API Route
This command allows you to create a new API route for your T4 application. Enter the name of the new route using lowercase camel case (e.g., myNewRoute). The command will generate a new router in the packages/api/src/routes folder and add it to the index.ts router. Afterward, it will open the new {routeName.ts} file for you to modify.
